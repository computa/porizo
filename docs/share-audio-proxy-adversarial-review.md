# Share-audio proxy — adversarial review (2026-05-10)

Pressure-testing `serveTrackAudio` after switching from `Readable.fromWeb` streaming to buffered `arrayBuffer()`. Goal: find the next way this code can fail silently and either fix it or capture it as a known risk.

## Threat model

The proxy sits between R2 (storage) and untrusted browser clients. It's reached via `/share/:id/audio` after the share-token auth check passes. Once a client has a valid share token, they can hit the audio endpoint as many times as they want.

| Attacker capability         | Fix scope                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forge share token           | Out of scope — share-token auth is upstream of this code       |
| Choose `Range` header       | In scope — must not crash or leak                              |
| Spam requests for one track | In scope — must not OOM or burn unbounded R2 egress            |
| Influence upstream key/file | Out of scope — keys are derived server-side from track/version |

## Failure modes — analysis + status

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Silent zero-body response (today's bug)

**Mechanism:** `Readable.fromWeb(r2Response.body)` emits 0 bytes under Node 20 + Fastify 4.29 + undici. Headers were correct, body was empty. Status 200 with `Content-Length: 0`.

**Why silent:** No error log, browsers showed generic "Unable to play this audio." Cloudflare cached the bad response (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`) so the failure was sticky.

**Fix shipped:** `Buffer.from(await r2Response.arrayBuffer())` + Fastify recomputes Content-Length truthfully from the buffer.

**Hardening shipped:**

- `BYTE_MISMATCH` warning when upstream Content-Length ≠ actual buffer length
- `EMPTY_BODY` → 502 STORAGE_EMPTY (instead of silent 200/empty)
- Contract test (`test/share-audio-proxy.test.js`) — empirically catches a regression that returns zero bytes
- Synthetic probe (`scripts/probe-share-audio.mjs`) — runs every 4h via launchd, exits non-zero on any byte-flow failure

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Memory pressure / OOM via oversized upstream

**Mechanism:** Buffering means the full upstream payload is in RAM until the response completes. A misuploaded 1 GB file would OOM the dyno (Railway small dyno = 512 MB).

**Fix shipped:** 50 MB cap on upstream Content-Length. Files larger than 50 MB get rejected with `STORAGE_OVERSIZED` 502 instead of triggering OOM. 50 MB covers the largest plausible full master with 4× headroom — current full m4a outputs are 2-3 MB.

### 3. ✅ FIXED: HEAD requests waste R2 egress

**Mechanism:** Fastify auto-handles HEAD by running the GET handler and stripping the body downstream — but our handler still does a GET upstream and downloads the full body to throw away.

**Fix shipped:** Detect `request.method === "HEAD"` and use HEAD upstream too. Saves R2 egress on social-card crawlers, monitoring probes, and HEAD-first audio elements.

### 4. ✅ FIXED: 416 Range Not Satisfiable was coerced to 404

**Mechanism:** `if (!r2Response.ok && r2Response.status !== 206)` returned 404 for any non-200/206 — including 416 (Range Not Satisfiable). A client doing a probe with `Range: bytes=999999999-` got "audio not found" instead of "range invalid."

**Fix shipped:** 416 passes through verbatim with `Content-Range` header.

### 5. 🟡 ACCEPTED RISK: Concurrency memory pressure

**Mechanism:** Each in-flight request holds its full upstream payload in memory. 100 concurrent listeners on a viral track × 3 MB = 300 MB peak RAM — within budget for a 512 MB dyno but uncomfortable.

**Mitigation (not yet implemented):**

- Cloudflare cache (`max-age=3600`) absorbs most repeats. Real R2 hits should be ~1/track-per-hour from the edge.
- The `iniflight` gauge: if we ever see Railway approaching memory limits, revisit streaming with a _known-good_ implementation (`stream.pipeline(r2Response.body, reply.raw)` with proper error handling).

**Tracking:** TODO if production traffic hits ~1k concurrent share players.

### 6. 🟡 ACCEPTED RISK: R2 truncation (correct length, partial body)

**Mechanism:** R2 advertises `Content-Length: 2290638` but only delivers 1.5 MB before connection closes mid-`arrayBuffer()`. Currently undici throws → caught by `try/catch` → 502.

If undici doesn't throw and returns a short buffer, our `BYTE_MISMATCH` warning fires but we still ship the partial data. Browsers may play the prefix before erroring.

**Decision:** Acceptable. Partial data is better than nothing for users; the warning makes the partial visible in logs. A stricter "block partial" mode could be added if it becomes a problem.

### 7. 🟡 ACCEPTED RISK: Cache poisoning of error responses

**Mechanism:** `sendError` returns JSON without explicit `Cache-Control`. Cloudflare default behavior on 4xx/5xx with no Cache-Control is generally not to cache, but edge configs vary.

**Mitigation:** Already added `Cache-Control: no-store` on the 416 response. The other error paths (`AUDIO_NOT_FOUND`, `STORAGE_EMPTY`, `STORAGE_OVERSIZED`, `STORAGE_ERROR`) inherit Fastify defaults. If we observe stale errors in production, revisit `sendError` to set `Cache-Control: no-store` for all error responses.

### 8. 🟡 NOTED: No upstream conditional headers forwarded

**Mechanism:** We only forward `Range`. We don't forward `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`, `If-Range`. R2 may return 304s that our proxy doesn't get to see, costing extra round-trips.

**Decision:** Low impact. Audio files are static; client cache (`max-age=3600`) avoids most re-requests anyway. Add forwarding only if measurements show otherwise.

### 9. 🟡 NOTED: No rate limit on `/share/:id/audio`

**Mechanism:** Documented as intentional (route comment: "No rate limit on playback — serving a cached audio file costs nothing"). True for our own bytes; not true for R2 egress costs if a malicious client spams.

**Decision:** Cloudflare caches the 200 response for 3600s, so most repeat hits don't reach origin. If we see anomalous R2 egress, add a per-token soft limit (e.g., 1000 hits/hour).

### 10. ✅ COVERED: Slow-trickle DoS

**Mechanism:** R2 sends bytes at 1 KB/s, holding the proxy connection open and tying up dyno resources.

**Fix in place:** `AbortSignal.timeout(30_000)` aborts after 30s. fetch throws → caught → 502 STORAGE_ERROR.
